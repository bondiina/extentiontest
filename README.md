üöÄ Frequently Asked Questions

‚≠êÔ∏è Are you going to make a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script?
Unfortunately, no. I do not have time to maintain any more code
‚≠êÔ∏è What about Vivaldi/Brave/Edge/Opera and other browsers?
The extension can be natively installed on all chromium browsers
‚≠êÔ∏è What about Safari and MacOs?
The store charges 100$ per year to post apps, which I cannot afford
‚≠êÔ∏è How can I use this on mobile?
Since neither Chrome or Firefox allow for extensions in mobile browsers, you need to install a chromium distribution that does. I recommend Kiwi Browser (if you have any issues, please report them, still testing mobile support)
